# Learning SQL

Welcome to my SQL learning journey!ðŸ˜Ž

This repo is where I document my practice and mini-projects as I build up my SQL skills.  
Over the next year, Iâ€™ll be uploading exercises, experiments, and projects to show my growth step by step.

# Repo Structure
The repo is organized into folders, starting with the **basics** and gradually moving toward a **main project**:

1. **01-basics** â†’ foundational SQL (databases, tables, constraints, inserts).
2. **02-joins** â†’ inner/outer joins practice.
3. **03-aggregates** â†’ `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, aggregate functions.
4. **04-subqueries** â†’ nested and correlated queries.
5. **final-project** â†’ a larger database project that ties everything together.

##  Goals
- Document my progress as I learn.
- Create a resource I (and others) can look back on.
- Build a portfolio of SQL skills for future opportunities.

 *This is a living repo and will keep growing as I learn new topics.*
